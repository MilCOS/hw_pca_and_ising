# Homework: Designating phases in the Ising model with machine learning
This is the final project for the class "Advanced computational methods".

---

The project reproduces parts of the results in Ref. [1] and Ref. [2]. The code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn package. The Monte Carlo simulations are implemented and adapted based on the source code from Repo. [3] and [4]. The final project serves as the starting point of a journey to optimization, machine learning and Monte Carlo methods.
